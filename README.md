PONGO!

This is a simple implementation of Pong in an asynchronos sense using Node.js and Socket.IO.
This can be run by running the command "node static_server.js" in the root directory.
navigate to the url. Default port is 3456. (for example: localhost:3456/client.html will run the game on your local machine.)

Special thanks to Shane Carr for the creation of pong-game.js and Michael Liu for his help on this project.

This project has been implemented to support deploying on Heroku. As of 11/20/2013 this app is running on cse330.herokuapp.com/client.html
